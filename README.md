# Object Detection Using Artifical Intelligence 

## Description
 Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and it is used to detect objects present in an image/video.object detection is to determine where objects are located in a given image (object localization) and which category each object belongs to (object classification).Object localization refers to identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing the box around their extent. 
 Object classification involves identifying the class of one object in an image. Object Detection(Our project) combines these two tasks and identifies and classifies one or more objects in an image.
 
 Our main motivation to select this topic is in present era with  the  rapidly  growing  importance  in  military  and  security  applications  visual  surveillance has  become  a  necessary  area  of  research for improvement . It   is very hard for human operators to monitor for long durations to identify the important events in real-time .But using this system we can detect the objects in the images of the video continuously in the military area to detect any suspicious activity. And it can be also used in many other areas. This gives us the interest to select this project. 
 
 object detection is able to provide valuable information for good understanding of images and videos, and is related to many applications, including image classification, human behavior analysis, face recognition, autonomous driving, video surveillance, and healthcare.
